# soso sign up form

True love doesn't exist!

Yes! You heard that right.

But hey, don't judge me. Before you crucify me, those weren't my words. Lol

****

Soso is a popular "fictional" dating app that lets people find true love using the power of music.

Stupid idea right? 

Hold on a sec! Don't tell me you missed it? 

Now go back and read the last three lines. Did you see the quote? Great! Now close your eyes and think about it.

Brilliant idea right? hehe

Don't try to hide that smile. I see it already.

Btw, this idea was inspired by popular musician Omah Lay and two of my friends; one who loves music and the other who thinks true love only exists in fairy tales. This repo is my implementation of the sign up page.
